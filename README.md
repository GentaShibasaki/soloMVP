# vue-app

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

# Overview of this app

This application aims for learning new words, if you start this app, and push "Start learning" button, the definition of a word you want to learn will be appeared in your mother language. All you have to do is type a spell of this word in other language you want to learn, and push "Answer" button! if the spell you typed matches an actual spell, you will see "Correct" on the page! But if they don't match, you will see "Not correct!!".
